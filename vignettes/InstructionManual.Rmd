# Introduction
Reproducibility of research is becoming more and more important ([nature special](http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552)). If we can't reproduce research results, how can we use them for future research? What is the value of irreproducible conclusions? To improve reproducibility training is important to boost reproducibility ([nature,2016](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)).

During this course we will introduce you to tools to make your code reproducible and re-usable for other researchers. As it's not possible to introduce you to all software we made a selection. Our focus will be on the reproducibility of code by introducing you to:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Rprojects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects), including [code documentation in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html) and [testing functions](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/testthat/versions/1.0.2/topics/testthat) 
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)

For a fully reproducible research you also want to link your data to GitHub, which is possible with e.g. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/github/). 

## Course schedule
The course is given at the [KNMI](https://www.knmi.nl/over-het-knmi/contact/contactformulier). Make sure you bring a passport or ID card. We meet in the reception hall downstairs.

* The code and instruction manual, can be found [here](https://github.com/MariekeDirk/Reproducibility-Reusability-course.git)


# Git and GitHub


## Git
Below an example of how git works. We start from scratsh by creating a test directory and a test file test.txt. We are going to change the content of the file, and revert the changes. 
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd ~./Documents/test
mkdir test
cd test
echo something > test.txt
ls
cat test.txt

git help
git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
git init
git add test.txt
git commit -m 'first commit'

echo test > test.txt

git commit -am 'commiting something which is wrong...'

git reset HEAD~
cat test.txt
```

My suggestion would be to make this session interactive with some exercises. 

The following topics I would suggest for this course:

Git:

* Local version control
* Using git to modify a .txt file with some text
* Practice commit & revert 

GitHub:

* Introduction (movie or something): Collaboration multiple people
* Private vs. Public
* Branches
* Push and Pull
* Forking someone's repo

## Suggested reading
* [git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)

# R projects & documentation of code
## Package structure

## Loading a the code from GitHub
1. Go to the [scource code](https://github.com/MariekeDirk/Reproducibility-Reusability-course.git) on GitHub and Fork the repository to your own account
2. Copy the https link using the button clone or download. 
3. Go to Rstudio, click on file, new project, version controls, git and paste the link. You can now work on the project from your own computer.

## Writing functions

Function are saved in the R folder. To document the function roxygen2 is used. Below an example of a function with documentation:

```{r function,eval=FALSE}
#'
#'@title Square area
#'@description Function to calculate the area of a square. Requires numeric input. 
#'@param length The length of the square [m]
#'@param width The width of the square [m]
#'@examples
#'square_area(4,5)
#'
#'\dontrun{
#'square_area(4,"5")}
#'@author Marieke Dirksen
#'@export
#'

square_area<-function(length,width){
  if(!inherits(length,"numeric") | !inherits(width,"numeric")) {
    message("Your length or width is not numeric")
    return(FALSE)
  } else {
    area<-length*width
    return(area)
  }
    
}

square_area(3,4)
```


The function description is stored in .Rd files (folder man). To add your function description to the documentation of your package use:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::document()
```

> **Excercise 3.1**
>
> Create your own Function and document the code in a .Rd file.   
> Suggestions: 
>
> * Calculate the area of a circle
> * Volume of a shpere 
> * Mean value from random numbers  

## Test your function
Sometimes your make small changes to your code without generating warnings or errors. It can however occur that the output of your function did change. To ensure that for the same input the function always generates the same output test functions are written. The test function in this package looks like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
context("test square area")
test_that("square area equal",{
expect_equal(square_area(3,4),12)
})
```

> **Excercise 3.2**
>
> Write a testthat function. An example is included in tests/testthat/   
> For more information check out the [R journal on testthat](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf) 

> **Excercise 3.3**
>
> Test the different options to built and reload your package.    
> There are buttons below Build, but you can use key combinations like: Ctrl+Shift+B, Ctrl+Shift+T and Ctrl+Shift+E
> Fix posible errors and warnings

## Documentation of datasets

# Putting it all together: combining Rstudio with GitHub
Now you have created your own function in the project, documented the code and solved all errors and warnings its time for the next step: Putting your code back on GitHub. 

Some suggestions for the course:

* config git user.name and user.email global
* commit changes
* push the changes to your github
* merge the forked branch with the master

If there is more time:

* revert changes
* stash and other options
 

# Protect your code: Travis CI

> Points to include:
>
>* Short overview of other systems checking your code
>* What travis does and why it is usefull for your research

* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is used to check your code you put on GitHub. You can login with your GitHub account.
* To include Travis CI to your repository check [this](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r) website. 
* To see if your branch passes the test you can add an image [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MariekeDirk/Reproducibility-Reusability-course.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MariekeDirk/Reproducibility-Reusability-course)

To this repository the .travis.yml file includes the following code:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
language: R
sudo: false
cache: packages
```

> **Excercise 5.1**
>
> Put your repositories on Travis CI and pass the test.

> **Excercise 5.2**
>
> (a) Create a branch with an error 
> (b) Merge a failed branch with the master
> (c) Revert the changes...we want a master without errors/warnings
> (d) Make your master branch protected
> (e) Try to merge the failed branch again
